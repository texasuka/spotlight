It makes it very difficult to establish the order of items or to hide items all together. In `src/data/nav-items.yaml`, you’ll list your nav items in order.\n\n```yaml\n- title: Menu\n  pages:\n    - title: Page 1\n      path: /menu/Page-1\n    - title: Page 2\n      path: /menu/Page-2\n- title: Single Page\n  pages:\n    - path: /single-page\n```\n\nSome important things to note here:\n\n- You only need to link to the first tab if using page tabs\n- The `title` refers to the menu and item text, it’s allowed to have spaces\n- The `path` refer to the relative path to the mdx file in your pages\n- You can make a `Page/index.mdx` file if you’d prefer to have assets in a folder.\n  The path would still just look like `/Page`\n\n## Adding a divider\n\nYou can add divider(s) between the items of your nav item list by adding `hasDivider: true` in `src/data/nav-items.yaml`. Note the divider is only for top-level nav items and can only be used with the left sidebar navigation style. It cannot be used in conjunction with the [header navigation style](/guides/configuration#navigation-style).\n\n```yaml\n- title: Menu\n  pages:\n    - title: Page 1\n      path: /menu/Page-1\n    - title: Page 2\n      path: /menu/Page-2\n  hasDivider: true\n- title: Single Page\n  pages:\n    - path: /single-page\n```\n\nIn the example above, a divider will appear between **Menu** and **Single Page**.\n\n## Customizing\n\nThe nav item list can be customized using Gatsby theme [shadowing](/guides/shadowing).\nSimply provide your own implementation of `/src/util/NavItems.js` which can augment or replace the nav items read from `src/data/nav-items.yaml`.\n\n```javascript\n// /src/util/NavItems.js\nimport { useNavItems as themeUseNavItems } from 'gatsby-theme-carbon/src/util/NavItems';\n\n// add nav items\nexport function useNavItems() {\n  const navItems = themeUseNavItems();\n  return navItems.concat({\n    title: 'Additional Nav Item',\n    pages: [\n      { path: '/page1', title: 'New Page 1' },\n      { path: '/page2', title: 'New Page 2' },\n    ],\n  });\n}\n```\n","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"a1b080a7a5a28c6e1070126537b8abfe","counter":241,"owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Navigation","tabs":["Sidebar","Tabs"],"description":"guide for adding and maintaining the sidebar entries"},"exports":{},"rawBody":"---\ntitle: Navigation\ntabs: ['Sidebar', 'Tabs']\ndescription: guide for adding and maintaining the sidebar entries\n---\n\n<PageDescription>\n\nOne of the most important pieces of making a working site is to define your navigation items.
